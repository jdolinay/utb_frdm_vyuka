Note:
The PTA4 pin (Arduino pin 4) is by default used as NMI input and
connecting low signal to this pin causes NMI interrupt - the default handler
is just endless loop. This is no problem if we use the PTA4 pin, because we
configure it to a different mode than NMI and all works fine.
However, if we by mistake connect the signal to this pin while it is not used
in the program, the program will hang (go into the default handler).


Solution:
a) configure the A4 pin as GPIO
b) provide NMI handler which does nothing.
